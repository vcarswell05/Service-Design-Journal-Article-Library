Service Design Weekly Digest

An automated, open-source weekly roundup of service design, UX, systems thinking, and design strategy content—curated from trusted industry blogs, research organizations, and journals.

This repository is designed to help service designers, UX practitioners, researchers, and strategists stay current without manual curation.

Each week, a GitHub Actions workflow pulls new content from a maintained list of sources and publishes a digest summarizing what’s new.
